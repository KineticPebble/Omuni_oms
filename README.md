I had been assinged task to download the file from omuni oms portal daily. (https://oms.omuni.com/oms/dashboard)
I tried checking for whether there is any api avaliable or not but could not find any documentation.
Then I started checking the request reposnse cycle in the browser and found the api endpoint used.
I integrated those api calls in my python code to make this project.
You can use this code if you are a user of the portal and want to get data from omuni oms portal directly.
Just fill the auth file with your credentials and verialble file with database and location.
